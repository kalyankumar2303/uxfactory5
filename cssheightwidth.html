      The action comes as lawmakers and administration officials are
      increasingly voicing concern that Russia may be using cryptocurrency to
      avoid the impact of sanctions imposed on its banks, oligarchs and oil
      industry due to the invasion of Ukraine. Last week, Democratic Senators.
      Elizabeth Warren, Mark Warner, and Jack Reed asked the Treasury Department
      to provide information on how it intends to inhibit cryptocurrency use for
      sanctions evasion. The Biden administration has argued that Russia won’t
      be able to make up for the loss of U.S. and European business by turning
      to cryptocurrency. Officials said the Democratic President's order had
      been in the works for months before Russia's Vladimir Putin invaded
      Ukraine last month. Daleep Singh, a deputy national security and economic
      adviser to Mr. Biden, told CNN on Wednesday that “crypto’s really not a
      workaround for our sanctions.” The executive order had been widely
      anticipated by the finance industry, crypto traders, speculators and
      lawmakers who have compared the cryptocurrency market to the Wild West.
      Despite the risks, the U.S. Government said, surveys show that roughly 16%
      of adult Americans — or 40 million people — have invested in
      cryptocurrencies. And 43% of men age 18-29 have put their money into
      cryptocurrency. Coinbase Global Inc., the largest cryptocurrency exchange
      in the United States, said the company had not seen a recent surge in
      sanctions evasion activity. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last week
      that “many participants in the cryptocurrency networks are subjected to
      anti-money laundering sanctions” and that the industry is not "completely
      one where things can be evaded.”
