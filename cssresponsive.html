      As for the Federal Reserve getting involved with digital assets, the
      central bank issued a paper in January that said a digital currency “would
      best serve the needs” of the country through a model in which banks or
      payment firms create accounts or digital wallets. Some participants in
      digital currency welcome the idea of more government involvement with
      crypto. Adam Zarazinski, CEO of Inca Digital, a crypto data company that
      does work for several federal agencies, said the order presents the
      opportunity to provide “new approaches to finance.” “The U.S. has an
      interest in growing financial innovation," Mr. Zarazinksi said. He added
      that China and Russia were looking at crypto and building their own
      currency. More than 100 countries have begun or are piloting their own
      digital sovereign currency, according to the White House. Katherine
      Dowling, general counsel for Bitwise Asset Management, a cryptocurrency
      asset management firm, said an executive order that provides more legal
      clarity on government oversight would be “a long term positive for
      crypto.” But Hilary Allen, a financial regulation professor at American
      University, cautioned against moving too fast to embrace cryptocurrencies.
