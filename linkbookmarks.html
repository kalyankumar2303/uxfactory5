      The action comes as lawmakers and administration officials are
      increasingly voicing concern that Russia may be using cryptocurrency to
      avoid the impact of sanctions imposed on its banks, oligarchs and oil
      industry due to the invasion of Ukraine. Last week, Democratic Senators.
      Elizabeth Warren, Mark Warner, and Jack Reed asked the Treasury Department
      to provide information on how it intends to inhibit cryptocurrency use for
      sanctions evasion. The Biden administration has argued that Russia won’t
      be able to make up for the loss of U.S. and European business by turning
      to cryptocurrency. Officials said the Democratic President's order had
      been in the works for months before Russia's Vladimir Putin invaded
      Ukraine last month. Daleep Singh, a deputy national security and economic
      adviser to Mr. Biden, told CNN on Wednesday that “crypto’s really not a
      workaround for our sanctions.” The executive order had been widely
      anticipated by the finance industry, crypto traders, speculators and
      lawmakers who have compared the cryptocurrency market to the Wild West.
      Despite the risks, the U.S. Government said, surveys show that roughly 16%
      of adult Americans — or 40 million people — have invested in
      cryptocurrencies. And 43% of men age 18-29 have put their money into
      cryptocurrency. Coinbase Global Inc., the largest cryptocurrency exchange
      in the United States, said the company had not seen a recent surge in
      sanctions evasion activity. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last week
      that “many participants in the cryptocurrency networks are subjected to
      anti-money laundering sanctions” and that the industry is not "completely
      one where things can be evaded.” As for the Federal Reserve getting
      involved with digital assets, the central bank issued a paper in January
      that said a digital currency “would best serve the needs” of the country
      through a model in which banks or payment firms create accounts or digital
      wallets. Some participants in digital currency welcome the idea of more
      government involvement with crypto. Adam Zarazinski, CEO of Inca Digital,
      a crypto data company that does work for several federal agencies, said
      the order presents the opportunity to provide “new approaches to finance.”
      “The U.S. has an interest in growing financial innovation," Mr. Zarazinksi
      said. He added that China and Russia were looking at crypto and building
      their own currency. More than 100 countries have begun or are piloting
      their own digital sovereign currency, according to the White House.
      Katherine Dowling, general counsel for Bitwise Asset Management, a
      cryptocurrency asset management firm, said an executive order that
      provides more legal clarity on government oversight would be “a long term
      positive for crypto.” But Hilary Allen, a financial regulation professor
      at American University, cautioned against moving too fast to embrace
      cryptocurrencies.

      On studying (them), we found that almost about 70% pertain to labour laws,
      for which the Parliament has enacted four Labour Codes to simplify these
      laws. So a major concern is already addressed, but we still need to work
      together to ensure that most of the States come on board and we are able
      to notify these changes,” Mr. Jain said at the annual conclave of the
      Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association. Urging start-ups to
      register on the new single window clearance system which had a ‘soft
      launch’ in September 2021, Mr. Jain said that close to 1,000 approvals had
      already been granted through the system so far with one ‘end-to-end’ nod
      under the vehicle-scrappage policy. “Till now, we have got 17,000-18,000
      users on the portal… But I would like it to be in lakhs, in millions, I
      would ask all start-ups to apply in the national single window for their
      new ventures and whatever problems you come across, please share with us,”
      Mr. Jain said. As many as 21 Central government departments’ permissions
      have been integrated into the system with 15 States also coming on board
      so far.

      The pair took no risks and offered no chances, and safely managed a
      largely toothless England attack. Holder, 43 not out, and Bonner, 34 not
      out, ground out 75 together at just over two runs an over until they were
      interrupted by a fourth shower and stumps were pulled. Their stand was in
      contrast to the innings' breezy start. The openers, captain Kraigg
      Brathwaite and the recalled John Campbell, coasted after England was
      bowled out for 311 from 268-6 overnight. Brathwaite and Campbell cruised
      past lunch and hit 13 boundaries and a six until Campbell's demise ended
      their stand on 83. Campbell was out down the leg side for 35. Brathwaite
      reached his fifty in only 62 balls but was prised out for 55 by fast
      bowler Mark Wood. Shamarh Brooks edged Ben Stokes to the slips on 18 and
      Jermaine Blackwood was dropped on 0 off Wood. The damage was minimal,
      though, as Blackwood was out for 11 to Chris Woakes after umpire Joel
      Wilson was reviewed and overturned. From 83 without loss, West Indies lost
      44-4 in 16 overs and a great start was at risk of being wasted. But Holder
      and Bonner blocked superbly and punished anything loose. They survived a
      period of reverse swing, and nine consecutive maidens by spinner Jack
      Leach, but the pressure wasn't applied from both ends. Woakes and Craig
      Overton led the England attack for the first time in the absence of the
      dropped James Anderson and Stuart Board and the injured Ollie Robinson,
      and failed to impress with the new ball and the old ball despite taking a
      wicket each. They were the most expensive, apart from a couple of overs of
      spin from part-timer Joe Root. Wood always menaced, and Stokes was watched
      carefully. But Holder and Bonner grew a little bolder as the wind picked
      up between the showers, and they gave West Indies hope of making the test
      a lasting contest. The day started with England batting and adding only 43
      runs to its overnight total. Jonny Bairstow moved from 109 to 140 off 259
      balls before he was last man out, slicing high to backward point. Fast
      bowlers Jayden Seales and Alzarri Joseph shared the last four wickets,
      Seales finishing with 4-79.

      Led by Roy Price, the studio has also lined up projects from Bollywood
      star Preity Zinta and critically acclaimed filmmaker Dibakar Banerjee.
      International Art Machine has acquired the rights of Tripathi’s Shiva
      Trilogy, which includes the books -- “The Immortals of Meluha” (2010),
      “The Secret of the Nagas” (2011) and “The Oath of the Vayuputras” (2013).
      The first book “The Immortals of Meluha” will be adapted into a digital
      show, to be directed by Kapur. Suparn S Varma of “The Family Man 2” fame
      will serve as a showrunner and also direct the series. Kapur, best known
      for “Elizabeth” and “Bandit Queen”, said he is excited to direct the
      series adaptation of Shiva Trilogy, which he said was "India’s great
      publishing sensation crossing every age and class". "It’s not just
      mythology, it’s modern storytelling at its best. Lending itself to a
      beautiful international series,” the filmmaker said in a statement. Varma
      said the trilogy is a genre-defining book and has become part of the
      pop-culture of the country. "I loved the reimagining and the
      world-building involving two of my favorite gods! The scale of vision and
      the ambition of our show visually and emotionally is as huge a task but we
      want to bring to audiences a vision that has never been seen before on
      screens," Varma added. Tripathi said he is thrilled to collaborate with
      Kapur, Varma and Roy. "One couldn't have asked for a better team than this
      to take my books into the audio-visual world. I am sure that with a team
      like this, we will create a web series that is worthy of Lord Shiva,” he
      added. As it enters India, International Art Machine said it is committed
      to creating credible, creative, commercial stories across theatrical and
      digital platforms and partnering with the top brass in the business for a
      massive launch slate. The studio will follow series adaptation of the
      Shiva Trilogy with the political thriller "Gods", to be directed by
      Dibaker Banerjee, and "The Kitty Party", a dramedy which will mark the
      directorial debut of Zinta, known for films like "Dil Se..", "Dil Chahta
      Hai", and "Veer-Zaara". "We are entering a new peak era for Asian original
      cinema and television. Everything we do supports that vision. India in
      particular, with its many people and stories, is poised to be a leader in
      a new multi-polar entertainment world. "I could not imagine a better
      project to start IAM’s life than Shiva, and there is no better dream team
      to fully realize the potential of Amish’s novels than Shekhar and Suparn.
      We are very excited about 'Shiva', 'The Kitty Party' with Preity Zinta and
      'Gods' with Dibakar Banerjee as our first slate in India," Price added.
