      On studying (them), we found that almost about 70% pertain to labour laws,
      for which the Parliament has enacted four Labour Codes to simplify these
      laws. So a major concern is already addressed, but we still need to work
      together to ensure that most of the States come on board and we are able
      to notify these changes,” Mr. Jain said at the annual conclave of the
      Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association. Urging start-ups to
      register on the new single window clearance system which had a ‘soft
      launch’ in September 2021, Mr. Jain said that close to 1,000 approvals had
      already been granted through the system so far with one ‘end-to-end’ nod
      under the vehicle-scrappage policy. “Till now, we have got 17,000-18,000
      users on the portal… But I would like it to be in lakhs, in millions, I
      would ask all start-ups to apply in the national single window for their
      new ventures and whatever problems you come across, please share with us,”
      Mr. Jain said. As many as 21 Central government departments’ permissions
      have been integrated into the system with 15 States also coming on board
      so far.
